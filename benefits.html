                <h2>Benefits Of Outsourcing Medical Billing Services</h2>
                <img src="img/benefits.webp" alt="">
                <p>There are many benefits to outsource medical billing service to a third party medical billing company. In fact, many health care providers are able to save time and money by outsourcing their medical billing and coding services. This allows providers to better focus their time and attention on providing quality care for their patients and improving patient flow and satisfaction.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <h1 style="font-size:2em; text-align: center;">Why Outsource Medical Billing Services to HRV</h1>
                <br>
                <p>HRV has everything you need to streamline your workflow and grow your revenue. By choosing the HRV company, you can better allocate your human and financial resources more effectively. Let’s take a look at some of the benefits that outsourcing with HRV can offer you and your team.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 style="font-size:2em; text-align: center;">More Focus on Patient Care</h1>
            <br>
          <p>Although medical billing is essential to the healthcare industry in United States, the heart of what you do is caring for patients. When you hire HRV, you can concentrate your resources into providing quality care. This will allow you to increase your patient flow and satisfaction from day to day, which will, in turn, provide you with more revenue. Your team cannot be effective in providing excellent care when they are bogged down by financial matters.</p> 
                <br>
                <h1 style="font-size:2em; text-align: center;">Reduced Administrative Duties
                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>Having an in-house billing team can cost you both time and money. Often for most health care providers, the in-house billing team is also the front desk staff. When the front desk is bogged down with preparing claims and keying in information, then that is time taken away from patients. This can limit your patient flow, which means less revenue by the end of the day. In addition, you will be reducing administrative costs by having an outsourced billing company to solve insurance conflicts. By saving on human resources you can put them back into the clinical aspect of your facility.</p>
                <br>

                <h1 style="font-size:2em; text-align: center;">Enhance Cash Flow
                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>By choosing HRV to be your revenue cycle management company, you can boost your revenue potential as much as 30%. You will have more time for your patients and get paid faster without the need to invest in on-going training. We build clean claims, and our claim acceptance rate is 99.9%. In addition, we save you money by reducing claim processing intervals, sending daily billing and accounts receivable follow ups on already billed claims and sending out clean claims right away.</p>
                <br>

                <h1 style="font-size:2em; text-align: center;">Reduce Billing Errors
                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>HRV will ensure that all your claims are accurately submitted within a timely manner. We can help reduce the number of rejected claims and provide feedback to help you maximize your reimbursements.</p>
                <br>

                <h1 style="font-size:2em; text-align: center;">Improve Patient Satisfaction
                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>When you reduce the burden placed on office staff, then you can increase productivity, efficiency, and employee morale. Your patients will have a direct line of communication with HRV customer service who are patient and kind when answering patient billing questions.</p>
                <br>

                <h1 style="font-size:2em; text-align: center;">Reduced Administrative Duties

                <br>

                <h1 style="font-size:2em; text-align: center;">Secure Patient Data
                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>Information on a medical file is 10 to 20 times more valuable than other types of digital data. When you outsource to HRV, you will have experts invest the money to protect patient information and ensure that the chance of a data breach is minimal.</p>
                <br>


                <h1 style="font-size:2em; text-align: center;">Ensure Billing Compliance
                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>HRV will help you stay up-to-date on compliance and regulation. The health care industry is ever-changing, and we can help with that.</p>
